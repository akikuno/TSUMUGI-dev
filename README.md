TSUMUGI (Trait-driven Surveillance for Mutation-based Gene module Identification) is a web-tool designed to extract and visualize gene modules based on phenotypic similarity, using phenotype data from single-gene knockout (KO) mice provided by the [International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC)](https://www.mousephenotype.org/).  

TSUMUGI is available as a web-tool that anyone can access from hereüëáÔ∏è

The name *TSUMUGI* is derived from the Japanese word **Á¥°„Åé (tsumugi)**, symbolizing the concept of *twisting various elements (genes) together to create a unified entity (phenotype)*.
